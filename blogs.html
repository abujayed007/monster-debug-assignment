        <h1>1. Difference between LocalStorage and Sessionstorage</h1>
        <h2>LocalStorage</h2>
        <p>
            Web storage can be viewed simplistically as an improvement on cookies, providing much greater storage capacity. Available size is 5MB which considerably more space to work with than a typical 4KB cookie.
            The data is not sent back to the server for every HTTP request (HTML, images, JavaScript, CSS, etc) - reducing the amount of traffic between client and server.
            The data stored in localStorage persists until explicitly deleted. Changes made are saved and available for all current and future visits to the site
        </p>
        <h2>Sessionstorage</h2>
        <p>
            It is similar to localStorage.
            Changes are only available per window (or tab in browsers like Chrome and Firefox). Changes made are saved and available for the current page, as well as future visits to the site on the same window. Once the window is closed, the storage is deleted
            The data is available only inside the window/tab in which it was set
        </p>
        <h1>2. Difference between Global Scope and Block Scope</h1>
        <h4>Global Scope</h4>
        <p>
            The variables defined outside of any function or curly brackets are known as global variables and have global scope. Global scope means that the variables can be accessed from any part of that program, any function or conditional state can access that variable.
        </p>
        <h4>Block Scope</h4>
        <p>
            This scope restricts the variable that is declared inside a specific block, from access by the outside of the block. The let & const keyword facilitates the variables to be block scoped. In order to access the variables of that specific block, we need to create an object for it. Variables declared with the var keyword, do not have block scope.
        </p>

        <h1>3.Event Loop</h1>
        <p>
            An event loop is an event-listener which functions inside the NodeJS environment and is always ready to listen, process, and output for an event.
            An event can be anything from a mouse click to a keypress or a timeout.These functions do not run line by line but only when they are required to run, irrespective of the function's declaration. In this case, the function runs automatically after 3 seconds when all synchronous functions have been executed.
        </p>
        <h1>4. Why we get undefined</h1>
        <p>
            1.If we don't do the variable initialiaz
            2.If don't return the function
            3.If we didn't call the function.
            4.If we don have any things right side of return.
            5.If we have any empty objece.
            6.If don't match the index renger.
